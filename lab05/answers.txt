NOTE:
- Your time complexities should be expressed in big-O notation and be in
  terms of n, where n is the number of people who  have  been  added  to
  Friendbook.

- Worst case time complexity: O(log(n))

- Explanation: Time complexity of nameToId is assumed to be log(n).

===============
FbMutualFriends
===============

- Worst case time complexity: O(n + log(n)) = O(n)

- Explanation: Time complexity of nameToId is assumed to be log(n) and time complexity of for loop is O(n).

===============

===============

- Worst case time complexity: O(n^2 + log(n)) = O(n^2)

- Explanation: Time complexity of nameToId is assumed to be log(n) and time complexity of nested for loop
is n^2.
