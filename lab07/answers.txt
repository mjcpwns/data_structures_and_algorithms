NOTE:
- Your time complexities should be expressed in big-O notation and be in
  terms of n, where n is the number of cells in the maze.

- Worst case time complexity: O(n)

- Explanation: since the graph is implemented in an adjacency matrix representation,
               all cells are traversed to check for neighbouring cells (for outgoing 
               edges)
